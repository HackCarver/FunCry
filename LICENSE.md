Let's start by clarifying what FunCry is NOT first. There's an assortment of
other softwares bundled together to make FunCry possible.

A: The CryENGINE 1.4 MOD SDK. This C++ SDK is provided freely, but it does
come with it's own license. FunCry relies heavily on this SDK.

B: The GRETA regex library has its own license.

C: The MinHook library has its own license.

D: The DirectX 9 SDK has its own license.

E: FunCry uses a modified version of FarOut Widescreen. This variant may
be updated as needed for the purpose of FunCry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

"FunCry" is a modification for the 2004 FarCry video game.

If you agree to:<br>
  A: include a copy of this license with each copy you distribute<br>
  B: not indicate that your version is the original or official variant<br>
  C: not modify FunCry to be malicious or harmful<br>
  D: not remove or alter attributions or credits (except for adding new credit for additions)

Then you may: freely use, modify and redistribute "FunCry" at your own
risk. This refers to the wholly unique additions such as the various c++
files that provide the core functionality of the mod, or the modpreview.dds
image. To the extent permitted by the CryENGINE 1.4 MOD SDK license, this
also applies to the MODIFICATIONS and ADDITIONS made to the SDK. Some care
has been taken to indicate these changes in the source files.

Note: In the case of an omission, any additional third party software is
likely accompanied by a copyright notice. This document does not re-license
any third-party software. They are provided as a convenience only.
